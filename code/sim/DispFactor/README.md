# Width Test Series

## Description

In this folder you find the outcomes of a test series, where ONLY the DISPERSIONFACTOR of the agents was changed. For 3 different Seeds (51, 151, 351), and each different dispersionfactors (1, 0.9, 0.8, ...), the simulation was run. 

## Files

To each of these runs, three files were generated:
* filename.mat - contains all the information gained
* filename.png - a printscreen of the last created output that shows jams
* filename.txt - contains the File "defineConstants" for reproducibility as well as the used mode.
