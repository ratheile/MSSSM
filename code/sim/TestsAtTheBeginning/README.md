# Tests At The Beginning

## Description

Here you can find some tests we took at the very first beginning of our simulation series.

## Files

* Behinderung.m - includes the defineConstants file used to generate the file Behinderung.png
* Test... - just some test runs with no special meaning
* TotalDistanceAndAgentsInSystemTest - A little test run to see how the total distance walked by all agents, number of agents in system, and the quotient of those to behave, and how they can be sub-plotted. Don't expect such plots to be smooth with longer simulations (this one was just 20sec=200 loops), as the distance will wobble around much more.
