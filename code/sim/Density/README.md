# Density Test Series

## Description

In this folder you find the outcomes of a test series, where ONLY the densities, namely DENSITYUP and DENSITYDOWN of agents incoming per second was changed. For 3 different Seeds (51, 71, 91), and for different combinations of up and down density (each combinations of elements of (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1), where densityup >= densitydown), the simulation was run. We didn't run the other combinations because the whole situation is symmetric.

Combinations simulated:
       |      DOWN      
       | 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0
------------------------
   0.4 |  X
UP 0.6 |  X   X
   0.8 |  X   X   X
   1.0 |  X   X   X   X

## Files

To each of these runs, three files were generated:
* filename.mat - contains all the information gained
* filename.png - a printscreen of the last created output that shows jams
* filename.txt - contains the File "defineConstants" for reproducibility as well as the used mode.
