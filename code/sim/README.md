# Simulation Series

## Description

In this folder you find the subfolders containing our test series where different variables were varied.

## Folders

* Against - Contains a test series where only few agents walking in one direction had to walk against a great number of agents walking in the other direction
* Density - Contains a test series where the density (#agents incoming) was varied, leading to jams when too high
* DispFactor - Contains a test series where the dispersion factor was varied, leading to chaos when high and lane formation when low
* HB - Contains simulations run with data we measured at the Zurich main station
* Influence - Contains a test series where the influence sphere radius (radius of semi-circle an agent looks into to decide where to walk next) was varied
* TestsAtTheBeginning - Contains some files generated when doing our first simulations
* Width - Contains a test series where the width of the hallway was varied, leading fastly to jams when too narrow, and free flow when wide
