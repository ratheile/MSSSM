# Influence Test Series

## Description

In this folder you find the outcomes of a test series, where ONLY the influence sphere radius, namely INFLUENCESPHERE, which represents the radius of the semi-circle an agent has a look into to decide where to walk next, was changed. For 3 different Seeds (51, 77, 151), and for four different values (1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 meters), the simulation was run.

## Files

To each of these runs, three files were generated:
* filename.mat - contains all the information gained
* filename.png - a printscreen of the last created output that shows jams
* filename.txt - contains the File "defineConstants" for reproducibility as well as the used mode.

## Data saves
