\subsection{Simplifications}
\begin{itemize}
\item[x] All our agents walk on their own, there are no groups of friends, families etc who stand together as much as possible.
\item[x] The agents are not able to walk backwards, they only can see and walk 90° to each side.
\item[?] All have the same mean speed, size, ??
\item[?] Any other simplifications?
\end{itemize}
