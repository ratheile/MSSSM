The heart of the simulation is the function \textit{logicFunction.m}, which determines the path any agent will choose to get to the other side of the hallway. It relies heavily on the two functions \textit{xValuesLogic.m} to deal with other agents and \textit{xWallLogic.m} to deal with agents representing the wall or static obstacles.\\
