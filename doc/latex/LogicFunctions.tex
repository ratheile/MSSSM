The heart of the simulation is the function \textit{logicFunction.m}, which determines the path any agent will choose to get to the other side of the hallway. To be more precise, it determines only the next step an agent will take and not the whole path. It relies heavily on the two functions \textit{xValuesLogic.m} to deal with other agents and \textit{xWallLogic.m} to deal with agents representing the wall or static obstacles. At first, the functioning of \textit{xValuesLogic.m} will be explained and afterwards the functioning of \textit{xWallLogic}.\\

\noi For two crossing agents, we used the following formulae
