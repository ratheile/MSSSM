% Simulation of a big inequality in the flux densities

\noi The experiments were only analyzed visually by judging how well our model could cope with the given task. Some exemplary pictures are given in figure \ref{}.\\

\noi For the densities 0.2/1 used in the first series, the overall success was satisfying. The agents walking up (red,
