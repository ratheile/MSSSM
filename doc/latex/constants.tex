%constants.tex

\noi The file \textit{defineConstants.m} contains all the constants that are used somewhere in the simulation. They can be grouped into several categories which are listed below, only the most important and most frequently changed constants are listed explicitly.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first section containing \texttt{XSCOPE} and \texttt{XRES} define the extent of the numerical approximations. An acceptable compromise between numerical resolution and runtime has to be chosen.
	\item In the second section, the model parameters can be set. They were explained in the subchapters about the logical functions and the spawning.
	\item The third section is used to define the field in which the agents whill walk.
	\item In the fourth and last section, general parameters concerning the simulation can be set. They include the time increment \texttt{DELTAT} and the number of loops \texttt{LOOPS} for the iteration process. The seed for the random number generator can be set with \texttt{SEED}.
\end{itemize}
\noi The seed for the random number generator is important to get random numbers but reproducible results.\\
Please note that early simulations may have a slightly different ordering of the constant variables in their logfiles.
