\subsubsection{Comparing measurements} %->Durchführung
Saturday, Nov 17th, we did some quick mesaurements right at Zurich main station to have some data we could compare. Two measurements were taken, only some minutes lay between these, that was when we measured the length and breadth of our corridor. The measurements were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The "boring" measurement: During 2 minutes 14 pedestrians headed tracks 3-18, and 20 pedestrians directed towards tram station "Bahnhofsquai". No problems at all, very fluently.
\item The "crowded" measurement: During 2 minutes, 41 pedestrians headed tracks 3-18, and 33 pedestrians directed towards tram station "Bahnhofsquai". People got stuck, ran into each other, had to walk stop-and-go-like.
\end{enumerate}
